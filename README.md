# Python - Flask Application

Heroku Link - [here](https://alba-task.herokuapp.com/)

A simple, quick and dirty flask REST API that does the following:

- Accepts a POST request with username, date, GPS coords, phonenumber and description
- Stores the data from the request in a database (SQLite3 was used here)
- Displays the results by search e.g date, username and phonenumber, etc
- Has a simple web frontend to test the API with a simple dashboard
